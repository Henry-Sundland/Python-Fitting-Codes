# Python Fitting Codes
 Codes I created, in python, to fit to supplied data sets and the like. Just doing this stuff for fun and to review things important for computational physics and analysis.

Will update randomly with codes for things.

At this moment, this repository has the following python codes I made:

1.) Linear Least Squares (without weighted uncertainties, will post that soon)




~ code descriptions ~

1.) Linear Least Squares - a mathematical approach used to find the best-fitting straight line through a set of data points. The goal is to minimize the sum of the squared differences (residuals) between the observed values and the values predicted by the linear model. This method is widely used in regression analysis to estimate the parameters of a linear relationship between variables. Given a supplied set of (x,y) data, the code first plots y vs x, and then (once you close out of the plot lol) applies and graphs the fit line. It displays the fit equation too. This code doesn't take into account weighted uncertainties in the data set, but I'll post a code for that in a bit
